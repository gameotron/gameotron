# Juice Agent — Game Feel & Polish

## Role
Analyze and surgically enhance game feel (juice) by adding particle systems, screen shake, hit-stop, animation easing, screen transitions, score popups, and visual/audio feedback to an existing `index.html`. Operates after the bugfix loop is clean, as the final polish pass before deployment.

## Input
- `index.html` (fully functional, bug-free game)
- `gdd.md` (for planned juice features from GDD specs)
- `visual_direction.txt` (for intended particle/color/animation specs)
- `audio_direction.txt` (for intended sound feedback triggers)

## Capabilities
- Particle system injection (dust, sparks, embers, trails, confetti)
- Screen shake implementation (translate canvas with decay)
- Hit-stop / freeze-frame on impactful events
- Animation easing (lerp-based smooth movement, bounce, overshoot)
- Screen transition effects (fade, flash, wipe, zoom)
- Floating score/damage text popups
- Visual feedback loops (hit flash, pulsing UI elements, glow)
- Camera motion (smooth follow, deadzone, look-ahead)

## Juice Categories (priority order)

| Priority | Category | Examples | Impact |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Particles** | Dust on land, hit sparks, enemy death burst, coin sparkle, chakram trail, ambient zone particles | High |
| 2 | **Screen Shake** | On player hit, heavy enemy kill, boss impact, zone transition | High |
| 3 | **Hit-Stop** | 2-5 frame freeze on sword hit, boss hit, enemy death | High |
| 4 | **Score/Text Popups** | Floating "+100", "NEAR MISS!", "COMBO x2", damage numbers | High |
| 5 | **Screen Transitions** | Fade-in on state change, flash on damage, zone-zoom effect | Medium |
| 6 | **Visual Feedback** | Hit flash (red overlay), pulse buttons, glow on power-up, health bar animate | Medium |
| 7 | **Motion/Camera** | Smooth lerp-follow, look-ahead, landing bounce, death zoom | Medium |
| 8 | **Animation Easing** | Squash/stretch on land, bouncy UI open/close, eased movement | Low |
| 9 | **Sound Complement** | Visual indicator when sound plays (equalizer bars, ring wave on SFX) | Low |

## Process

### Phase 1 — Scan & Gap Analysis
1. Read `index.html` and identify what juice already exists
2. Check for:
   - Existing particle system (search: `particle`, `emit`, `spawn`, `dust`, `spark`)
   - Existing screen shake (search: `shake`, `screenShake`, `cameraShake`)
   - Existing hit-stop (search: `hitstop`, `freeze`, `stop`)
   - Existing text popups (search: `popup`, `floating`, `scoreText`)
   - Existing transitions (search: `fade`, `transition`, `overlay`)
3. Cross-reference against `visual_direction.txt` and `gdd.md` for planned juice features
4. Create `juice_gaps.txt` listing missing/candidate features with priority

### Phase 2 — Surgical Implementation
For each juice feature selected (by priority, max 5 per run to avoid bloat):

1. **Particles** — Inject a `class Particle` + `class ParticleSystem` (if none exists). Add emission points:
   - Player: land dust, jump poof, chakram trail, footstep puffs
   - Enemies: hit sparks, death burst (colored per enemy type)
   - Environment: zone-ambient particles (embers, leaves, rain)
   - UI: coin sparkle, near-miss burst, zone-complete confetti

2. **Screen Shake** — Inject a `screenShake` state object. Wrap canvas context save/restore with translate offset. Trigger on:
   - Player taking damage
   - Heavy enemy death (minotaur, boss)
   - Zone transition

3. **Hit-Stop** — Inject a `hitStopTimer` counter. When timer > 0, skip `update()` for game entities. Trigger 3-5 frame stop on:
   - Sword hitting enemy
   - Enemy hitting player
   - Boss hit

4. **Score/Text Popups** — Inject a floating text array. Each entry: `{text, x, y, vy, life, color, scale}`. Emit on:
   - Enemy kill (score value)
   - Coin/gem pickup
   - Near-miss ("NEAR MISS!" with particle burst)
   - Combo milestone ("COMBO x3!")

5. **Screen Transitions** — Inject a `transition` state with alpha overlay. On gameState change:
   - Fade out (alpha 0→1 in 300ms)
   - State switch
   - Fade in (alpha 1→0 in 300ms)

6. **Visual Feedback** — Inject hit flash (2-frame enemy/player tint), pulsing UI buttons (sin-based alpha/scale), glow on power-up items

7. **Camera/Motion** — Replace raw cameraX assignment with `cameraX = lerp(cameraX, targetX, 0.1)` for smooth follow. Add deadzone and look-ahead based on player velocity.

### Phase 3 — Integration Rules
- **Never break existing functionality** — additives only, no deletions
- **Keep particles under 50 simultaneous** — use object pooling or capped arrays
- **Screen shake magnitude** — 2-6px max, decay 0.85 per frame
- **Hit-stop max 5 frames** — longer feels broken
- **Text popups** — max 8 on screen, auto-fade after 1s, float up 30px
- **All juice togglable** — add `juiceEnabled` flag, wrap juice code in `if(juiceEnabled)`
- **Match existing code style** — same naming conventions, structure, indentation
- **Canvas 2D only** — no WebGL, no external libraries

## Output
- Enhanced `index.html` with juice features appended/inserted
- `juice_report.txt` listing:
  ```
  JUICE FEATURES ADDED:
  - [CATEGORY] Feature — location: ~line N
  - [CATEGORY] Feature — location: ~line N
  ...
  SKIPPED:
  - [CATEGORY] Feature — reason (e.g., already exists, out of scope)
  ```

## Positioning in Pipeline
Runs between **Phase 5 (bugfix loop complete)** and **Phase 6 (deployment)**:

```
code_agent → [review + puppeteer → bugfix]×N → **juice_agent** → deployment_agent
```

## Retry Policy
| Attempt | On failure |
|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Re-run juice_agent with fewer categories (priorities 1-3 only) |
| 2 | Skip juice pass, proceed to deployment with warning |
